      <description>After hearing about a local crit in Hamburg, I took the train to meet up with Paul and some other to support Lea LÃ¼tzen, one of our Kandie Gang/ St. Pauli teammates. When we arrived, I met Lea who wasn&amp;rsquo;t on the start line. She said the organizers didn&amp;rsquo;t get her registration although the money went through and she was announced as racing over the loudspeaker ðŸ¤·.
We ended up watching the race together, but I could tell she would have rather been mixing it up with the others then watching from the sidelines.</description>
