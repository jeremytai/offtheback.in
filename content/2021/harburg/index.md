Yes, the last race of the 2021 was cold. Very, very cold.

I grew up in Minnesota, so theoretically, I should be okay with this weather. That beind said, I've lived in Hamburg over 15 years and the weather here is cold but not Minnesota cold. Over the years, my body has acclimated too much to the Northern German winters with their wet and somewhat mild winters.

Needless to say, the 42. Weihnachtscross (Christmas 'Cross) was so cold that the ground was frozen solid making for an extremely fast 2.6km course. In German they say, "Ballern" which means going hard and fast...stimmt?!?

It also meant that this was really not my kind of course as I typically do better at the more technical courses. On the start line, I was debating to keep my Patagonia Nano Puff on but decided not to in the end. So, I peeled it off (thanks @jessica_hoerig_  for holding it for me) and settled in for the start...

Four laps later I crossed the line in 2nd place four seconds off the winner...knowing I still need to learn a lot more about cyclocross before I can consistently place in the top 10.
