After hearing about a local crit in Hamburg, I took the train to meet up with Paul and some other to support [Lea LÃ¼tzen](https://www.instagram.com/leas_tri_journey/), one of our Kandie Gang/ St. Pauli teammates. When we arrived, I met Lea who wasn't on the start line. She said the organizers didn't get her registration although the money went through and she was announced as racing over the loudspeaker ðŸ¤·. 

We ended up watching the race together, but I could tell she would have rather been mixing it up with the others then watching from the sidelines.
