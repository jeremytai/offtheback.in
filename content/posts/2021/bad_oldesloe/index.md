This weekend was the first cx race weekend in the last three weeks that wasnâ€™t a double race weekend. And let me tell you, Iâ€™m more than happy about that as Bad Oldesloe was a technical grind with a good amount of climbing and off-camber, muddy descents onto mud slick paved roads.

I ended up 3rd which Iâ€™m quite happy about as Iâ€™ve only got my a bike last September of last year. Needless to say, thereâ€™s still have a lot to learn.

And I didnâ€™t crash ðŸ¤ž
