All morning and early afternoon it was raining cats and dogs. After checking the weather radar and communicating a shorter route on Strava, we held our breath and crossed our fingers in the hopes that the weather algorithms would be correct.

Between two and three o‘ clock the rain let up and we started to gather at the Kandie Shop dressed to the nines for the 2nd Annual Kandie Gang Halloween Ronde 🎃
