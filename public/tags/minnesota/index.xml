      <description>Cyclocross is finally1 here.
Here being Minnesota where I&amp;rsquo;ve been for the past six weeks or so for the summer. With cyclocross season just around the corner in Germany, I was stoked to be able give my legs a warm start into the coming race season by entering the first of six Tuesday Night CX races held around the suburbs of Minneapolis.
An 18:00 start with temperatures at 26Â°C (80Â°F) and humidity of 46% ðŸ¥µ was in complete contrast to what I&amp;rsquo;m used to cyclocross racing in Europe.</description>
