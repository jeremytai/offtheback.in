      <description>Halloween is a big deal for me as I grew up in the USA where I remember trick or treating from my formative years. So, last October 31st, I did a gravel ride organized by Mattis and decided to dress-up.
This year, I knew I wanted to something where other people could experience the joy of biking in a costume as I did last year. Luckily for me I had a co-conspirator in Christine.</description>

      <description>tl;dr Yes, I recommend attending. Now check out some photos here.
Here&amp;rsquo;s why&amp;hellip;
The Orbit360 Gravity Bike Festival hearkens back to my formative years; summers spent outdoors at camp in rural Minnesota where activities were plenty and a sense of new transformed to the familiar over the course of a few days.
If you’re looking for a shared experience with the bicycle as the main vehicle, some electro beats and a fun-loving community then you’ve come to the right place.</description>
