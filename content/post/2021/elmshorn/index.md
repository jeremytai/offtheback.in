It’s been two weeks since the last race weekend, and I have to say, it was worth the wait as Gunnar Harms and the [RG UNI Hamburg Club](https://www.rg-uni-hamburg.de) created one of the best cyclocross courses of the entire Stevens Cup Series.

The pièce de résistance was the Butterberg; standing at 17 meters tall the Butterberg is more of a hill than a mountain. Nonetheless, Elmshorn’s tallest point made for some punchy climbs (and a stair section) and fast descents along loamy, hard-packed single track.

My start had me in second place with two bike lengths off the leader. About halfway into the first lap I was passed and dropped to third which I would hold for the first two laps. On the third lap a mountain biker overtook me and was able to keep far enough away from me to take 3rd place leaving me a 4th place finish.

Overall, I’m quite okay with my ride today as we go into the last half of the cyclocross season. Tomorrow is another day and another race.
