Another Sunday cyclocross race and another birthday ðŸ¥³.

Today marked the "one race over the half-way point" in the Cyclocross Nord race series. The cyclocross course around the *Kolonistenhof* in Neu Duvenstedt is one that fills the legs up with lactate and keeps you on your toes with a single-track technical section on the backside of the course and rolling soft grass on the frontside.

From the start I didn't feel I had the legs and was lagging behind people I typically am in front of. After falling back a few places and settling in on the first lap I was able to get back into a pace that had me take home an 8th place.

On the last lap, with a long gap in front of me and another behind me, I took it easy and rolled a little bit with [Janine](https://www.instagram.com/jaja.hamburg/) and finished up with [Katrin](https://www.instagram.com/clara_bow/).

Afterwards, we stayed and watched a few more races and celebrated Lea Luise's birthday ðŸ¥³ with cake from her mom and an apple one from Janine.
