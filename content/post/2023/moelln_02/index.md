Waking up to a blue sky and sun looked promising for the second day in MÃ¶lln ðŸŒž

Cycle cross conditions are typically wet and cold so when days like last Sunday happen, it makes one appreciate them even more so. Sunday for cyclocross, at least youâ€™re in Germany, typically means more people line up at the start. This is because most commercial stores are closed on Sunday so if you havenâ€™t taken care of everything you need to take care of on Saturday then you have to wait until Monday.

That sun was no exception; for the start of the Masters 3 race, there were thirty men lined up. Fortunately for me, I had a second row start and was able to take stay in the top eight before the first pinch point (a sweeping left that led under a bridge).

My legs felt strong which was good as the conditions were drying up and the course was a lot faster than Saturdayâ€™s muddy slog. That said, I was able to ride all of the technical sections, except for one heavily rutted muddy incline that had me on my side three times before I could ride it. This would cost me a few places, and eventually, I would drop back to an eleventh place finish.

I still have five weeks before the [Masters Cyclocross World Championships](https://my.raceresult.com/260044/participants) on the 1 - 3 of December which should be enough time to work on my start and build on my fitness.

Thank you for supporting me and cheering me on at the races and thank you Pirate Bikes for putting on an unforgettable double race weekend.
