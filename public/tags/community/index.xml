      <description>Today was the one year anniversary of Kandie Gang Social Rides, and let me tell you, it was a quite a ride. We grew from 11 riders to over 50 today. Although we have grown, the Kandie Gang ethos and purpose remain the same:
It’s about Streetlife.
It’s about Urbanity.
It’s about Gettin Together.
It’s about Having Fun.
It’s about Riding.
It’s about Adventure.
It’s about Gettin Out.
It’s about Freedom.</description>
