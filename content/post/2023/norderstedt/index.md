This season, I’ve made the jump from hobby to licensed as the UCI Masters World Championship will take place here in Hamburg. So, no more mountain bikes and a thirty minute sprint and instead only fast men on 33mm tires for a full forty minutes of all out racing.

The season opener was in the forests of Norderstedt; my favorite course in the Stevens Cyclocross Cup due to its technical, single-track forestry-vibe.

I’m happy with my results, 13th of 33, and know there’s room to improve.
