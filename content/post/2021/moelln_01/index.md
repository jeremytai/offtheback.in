This past weekend was spent in M√∂lln for the fifth and sixth edition of the Stevens Cyclocross Cup. Billed as the ‚ÄúKing of Pirates‚Äù it definitely lived up to its name; with skull and cross bone flags raised on flagpoles to the pirate headwear for podium finishers.

The event took place at the local motorbike track making for a festive, adrenaline-filled venue where spectators could watch the racers on 92% of the course.

Saturday the riders rode clockwise and Sunday they rode the same course but counter clockwise. The course was technical but rideable and included Schnecken and pump sections as well as a good amount of punchy climbs. Sunday was definitely the faster of the two days.

Kandie Gang camped out on the starting line both days providing motivational, musical and post-race nutritional support. Needless to say, the Kandie Gang fun-loving hospitality was experienced by everyone.
