Halloween is a big deal for me as I grew up in the USA where I remember trick or treating from my formative years. So, last October 31st, I did a gravel ride organized by [Mattis](https://instagram.com/matzelfratzel) and decided to dress-up.

This year, I knew I wanted to something where other people could experience the joy of biking in a costume as I did last year. Luckily for me I had a co-conspirator in [Christine](https://instagram.com/christine_vds).

Originally, Christine and I were thinking a gravel tour but, the day before was the Schotter Westen 100 from [Traktor.Scheisse.Spritzen](https://instagram.com/traktor.scheisse.spritzen). Needless to say, we decided on having a relatively east 40 - 50km all-road tour.

We were also thinking of staring in the late morning but that changed after I had a conversation with [Wiebke](https://instagram.com/wibuhamburg). She convinced me that an afternoon start would be better as we'd be able to see the kids out trick or treating just as we were finishing up.

Planning a route for a diverse group of cyclists that would all be wearing costumes isn't a trivial as one would think. Afer some discussion with Christine I came up with track that would, I hoped, be memorable.

Like all good tracks, it's best to ride it before releasing it for others to ride. I ended up riding half of it with my youngest son, and a few days later, rode all of it making sure not to make it public on Strava. After a few adjustments we had a route.

It's been said that life happens in between the plans you make and this is exactly what happened but, it wasn't long before the day had finally come...
