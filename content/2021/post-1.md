Today was the first race of the Stevens Cyclocross Cup 2021/22 in Hannover, Germany. It’s also been a year of since my first cyclocross race and my third CX race since I bought a bike last September.

This year I actually have some base kilometers from the summer which helped in getting a 10th place finish. Another factor is the gracious nature of the CX community in sharing their experience on and off the bike.

Stop by and say “Hi!” when you see me 👋
