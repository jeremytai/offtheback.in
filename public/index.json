I was also looking to ride with the other 78(!) people that were registered in my age group.\nDuring my pre-ride of the new course, I remembered riding some of the same trails during the RG Wedel e.V.

In the end, the course was fast and friendly with only three obstacles where I had to dismount from my bike and jump over.\nBravo Martin üëè\nOnto the Race Of the 78 men that registered only 30 showed up ü§∑.

So, last October 31st, I did a gravel ride organized by Mattis and decided to dress-up.\nThis year, I knew I wanted to something where other people could experience the joy of biking in a costume as I did last year. Luckily for me I had a co-conspirator in Christine.\nOriginally, Christine and I were thinking a gravel tour but, the day before was the Schotter Westen 100 from Traktor.Scheisse.Spritzen. Needless to say, we decided on having a relatively east 40 - 50km all-road tour.\nWe were also thinking of staring in the late morning but that changed after I had a conversation with Wiebke. She convinced me that an afternoon start would be better as we\u0026rsquo;d be able to see the kids out trick or treating just as we were finishing up.\nPlanning a route for a diverse group of cyclists that would all be wearing costumes isn\u0026rsquo;t a trivial as one would think. Afer some discussion with Christine I came up with track that would, I hoped, be memorable.\nLike all good tracks, it\u0026rsquo;s best to ride it before releasing it for others to ride. I ended up riding half of it with my youngest son, and a few days later, rode all of it making sure not to make it public on Strava.

Last year this was the first race of the series making for a slow transition into what would be my first full season of racing.\nAs my race started first, the ground was still sticky with pasty mud and wet grass.

My choice in pedals and shoes would ultimately cost me a good start (I got taken down and went over the bars trying to clip in ü§™) and later, drop me down four places as I lost my front wheel in a sandy corner and laid the bike down (clipping out took too long as well as clipping back in).

Needless to say, I was caught by her contagious enthusiasm and was all in when the registration for this year\u0026rsquo;s edition opened up.\nWhich brings us to Friday and sitting in the back of Cindy\u0026rsquo;s cherry red VW Bulle, with Christina riding shotgun, on the way east past Berlin to a small village in Brandenburg, Germany.

And like most gravel races, the peloton would thin out into a ragged line of riders, each finding their own group to ride with to the end.\nThere was a good amount of sand (I was used to it from cyclocross) and a long 8km section of loose gravel (it had me thinking twice about a future participation in Unbound Gravel). Everything else (cobblestones, single-track and a smooth pavement section or two) was nestled into the wilderness that East Germany offers.\nThe course was challenging but not enough to drain me of a solo 200m sprint to the line.

After getting a car share, driving to the airport and checking-in I was well into my very first trip to Mallorca‚Ä¶\nThe trip had been planned for a while, but I was orginally not part of the group as I had been planning to go heli-snowboarding in Alaska. Russia\u0026rsquo;s attack on Ukraine put that trip on hold as a didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be so far away from my family in case something was to happen in Germany\u0026hellip;one never knows with Putin. So, it was in good fortune that a place opened up for a bike trip to Mallorca under leadership of Uwe who I had rode with last year on the 350km Maasholm day tour.\nI had never been üçí to Mallorca but had heard that it\u0026rsquo;s quite popular for Germans to visit due to it being in close proximity to Germany as well as a climate and geography that caters to cyclists. After having watched a documentary on the origins of Rapha in which the founder, Simon Mottram, gives praise to the Spanish island I was curious to experience it for myself.\nüìí Mallorca Shake out üóìÔ∏è April 2nd, 2022 üö≤ 58.2km with 566m elevation üåû Clear sky, 13¬∞C, Feels like 11¬∞C, Humidity 42%, Wind 22km/h from NW üìç Komoot link: Malle 58 - 540 - Petra - short Day 02 This morning Mallorca threw us early spring sun rays framed by a warm blue sky. It wasn‚Äôt until around 11:30 when the signs of things to come made themselves known; cold rain drops that turned into kernel-sized hail. This eventually stopped but left the sky a mass of ever-darkening clouds.\nShortly before our lunch break in Selva, the skies opened up sending a deluge of water upon us. We ended up staying at a restaurant ordering caf√® con leche to warm the body followed by grilled sandwiches and locally baked chocolate and almond cake.\nIt was still raining out so we stayed a bit longer to watch MvdP move to the front of the pack in the Tour of Flanders with nearly 50km to go. By the time we left, the rain had given pause lending us the perfect opportunity to head back home‚Ä¶a cold and wet affair.\nüìí Moody Mallorca Sunday Ride üóìÔ∏è April 3rd, 2022 üö≤ 99.74km with 813m elevation üå¶Ô∏è Overcast clouds, 10¬∞C, Feels like 9¬∞C, Humidity 64%, Wind 22km/h from ESE üìç Komoot link: Malle 114 - 800 Day 03 Today, after we rode for 40km or so, we broke up into two groups; one that would ride a nice little climb and one that would ride a relatively flat route to Palma. I chose the climbing group as I was looking to get some vertical kilometers while visiting Mallorca.\nThe 540m climb up Puig de Randa didn\u0026rsquo;t dissapoint as there was also a good amount of wind to deal with while navigating the twists and turns of the climb. We descended down into a 37km/h headwind making it feel as the descent was nearly as difficult as the ascent.\nüìí 100km x 1333m Mallorca üóìÔ∏è April 4th, 2022 üö≤ 100.59km with 1,333m elevation ‚òÅÔ∏è Overcast clouds, 10¬∞C, Feels like 9¬∞C, Humidity 63%, Wind 37km/h from NE üìç Komoot link: Malle - Randa - 96km 1060hm Day 04 This morning we met up with some of the ladies from Gruppetto Hamburg and headed out for a 90km loop that included another climb (yippee!) up Puig de Inca as well as a good amount of winding country roads. The wind was doing its best to blow us around the countryside but the sun was also out warming the pale Northern Germany skin.\nA highlite for me was a quick descent into the Cala Sant Vicen√ß which is nestled in a small valley along the Mallorca\u0026rsquo;s northwest coast. It was the striking blue water crashing along the jagged coastline, as well as the smell of salty ocean air, that did it for me.\nüìí North/South X Gruppetto üóìÔ∏è April 5th, 2022 üö≤ 89.22km with 613m elevation ‚õÖ Broken clouds, 13¬∞C, Feels like 12¬∞C, Humidity 58%, Wind 31km/h from ENE üìç Komoot link: Malle - Puig de Inca und San Vincent - 89 - 610 Day 05 Day five was a rest day\u0026hellip;but I went for a solo ride anyway.\nüìí **Mallorca Rain, Climbs, Sand - Solo ** üóìÔ∏è April 6th, 2022 üö≤ 82.63km with 832m elevation üåßÔ∏è Overcast clouds, 11¬∞C, Feels like 10¬∞C, Humidity 88%, Wind 13km/h from NNW üìç Komoot link: Malle 82 - 800 - Kloster - Solo Day 06 The sixth day was for climbing. And climb we did with a total of 1,956m (6417 feet) which is a quite a good amount considering I live in quite possibly the flattest city in Germany. I can\u0026rsquo;t remember when I last did a nearly hour of just climbing\u0026hellip;perhaps when I live in Vail, Colorado and we used to climb the mountain after work.\nLunch was taken in a village restaurant along the top of the climb, 74km into the ride, in the village of Deia. Later on, after the second climb and with nearly 16km to go, I realised I hadn\u0026rsquo;t eaten enough as I was feeling a bonk coming on and had to borrow a granola bar from Birte to make back to the hotel.\nOn the last descent, one of our riders went down and broke his collarbone and three ribs (ouch!). Forutnately, Uwe was able to get some help and have him picked up at the next village. While we all waited for him to get pick-up, Manny told me that 3-4 people die each year while overdoing it on the descents in Mallorca.\nüìí Malle - Vademossa, Puig Major üóìÔ∏è April 7th, 2022 üö≤ 147.08km with 1,956m elevation üåû Clear sky, 16¬∞C, Feels like 16¬∞C, Humidity 62%, Wind 15km/h from WSW üìç Komoot link: Malle 148 - 2000 - Port Valdemossa/ Puig Mayor Day 07 After yesterday‚Äôs epic ride, the goal today was to take it a bit easy with two off-the-bike breaks planned. The wind as still blowing, so there was no escaping that\u0026hellip;as well as the climbs. While not as epic in comparison to yesterday\u0026rsquo;s ride, we still rode a warm and windy affair that included 1,127 vertical meters of climbing with a total distance of 112.91km.\nüìí Mallorca - Mellow Roll Out üóìÔ∏è April 8th, 2022 üö≤ 112.91km with 1,127m elevation üåû Few clouds, 22¬∞C, Feels like 22¬∞C, Humidity 49%, Wind 8km/h from WNW üìç Komoot link: Malle 120-1200 - Sant Salvador Day 08 Our last ride day came sooner than expected after spending the last eight days exploring 745.3 km (463.1 miles) of Spanish pavement and 7.681m (25,200 ft) of vertical elevation. This being my first time on the island, I hope it‚Äôs definitely not my last.\nüìí Last day‚Ä¶sightseeing tour üóìÔ∏è April 9th, 2022 üö≤ 55km with 441m elevation ‚õÖ Broken clouds, 19¬∞C, Feels like 18¬∞C, Humidity 42%, Wind 22km/h from NW üìç Komoot link: Malle - 60 - 450 - Formentor All photographs appearing in the website are the exclusive property of Jeremy Tai Abbett (unless stated otherwise) and are protected under international copyright laws.
