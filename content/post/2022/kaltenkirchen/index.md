Today was the 5th leg of the Stevens Cyclocross Cup. The course was a change-up from the last two years with more single-track and just as much sand. All in all the new single-track and punchy inclines brought a new perspective to the race.

With a proper Indian Summer in late October ðŸŽƒ, it was the kind of day that brought out more people with my age category (50+) being having the most with [45 registered](https://my.raceresult.com/212335/participants#1_BA110D) to race. I had a good start and was top five in the first lap but slowly dropped back and ended up in 9th.

Today's race also coincided with my birthday ðŸ¥³.

One of my gifts was having Franziska and Niilo watch me race as they hadn't seen me race up until today. Sebastian also made a homemade CX marble cake in the Kandie Gang colors which was the perfect end to a beautiful day ðŸŽ‚.
