      <description>The week before today, I was out binging on Netflix and copious amount of tea. Yes, my body took a hit after I put in a bit too ambitious run around the Alster. That said, after a week of couch surfing üõãÔ∏è it was time to test the lungs and line-up for the 8th race in the Stevens Cyclocross Series.
Being that it was RG Wedel&amp;rsquo;s first cross race, and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t had the chance to preride before today, I was looking forward to experiencing a completely new cyclocross course.</description>

      <title>Bad Oldesloe CX</title>

      <description>Inspired by the recent Cyclocross World Championships in Namur, this year&amp;rsquo;s edition of the Stevens Cyclocross Cup in Bad Oldesloe had more climbing, more off-camber and more action than all the races. That being said, it was a challenging course that gave the advantage to those with a little more on-the-bike technical ability.
I had a good start and was top three going into the first off-camber section. Somewhere along the first lap my front tire lost some air in a corner making for a less than confident ride for the remaining laps.</description>

      <description>Another Sunday cyclocross race and another birthday ü•≥.
Today marked the &amp;ldquo;one race over the half-way point&amp;rdquo; in the Cyclocross Nord race series. The cyclocross course around the Kolonistenhof in Neu Duvenstedt is one that fills the legs up with lactate and keeps you on your toes with a single-track technical section on the backside of the course and rolling soft grass on the frontside.
From the start I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel I had the legs and was lagging behind people I typically am in front of.</description>

      <description>Today was the 5th leg of the Stevens Cyclocross Cup. The course was a change-up from the last two years with more single-track and just as much sand. All in all the new single-track and punchy inclines brought a new perspective to the race.
With a proper Indian Summer in late October üéÉ, it was the kind of day that brought out more people with my age category (50+) being having the most with 45 registered to race.</description>

      <description>Hannover is just under two hours away from Hamburg when it&amp;rsquo;s 7:00 am in morning on a national holiday. That said, I was up early to pack the car and pick-up Katrin for the fourth series in the Stevens Cyclocross Cup. Last year this was the first race of the series making for a slow transition into what would be my first full season of racing.
As my race started first, the ground was still sticky with pasty mud and wet grass.</description>

      <description>The winding, root infested single-track in the Rantzauer Forst of Norderstedt is my favorite course of the whole Stevens Cyclocross Cup race series. It evokes memories of riding 26 inch wheeled mountain bikes üö≤ in Minnesota from my formative days. Add a good amount of sloppy mud and it becomes a recipe for goodness.
Today&amp;rsquo;s race was just that; a rainy half-hour, heart pumping slog of four laps where one had to match physical output with a healthy dose of technical savvy.</description>

      <description>Cross is here&amp;hellip;day 02 üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
Like last year, the second half of the race weekend in M√∂lln is run on the same course as the first day but in the opposite direction; in this case counter clockwise. I definitely felt the course had more flow to it as we didn&amp;rsquo;t have the longish climb on the backside making for quicker course times.
I felt better than yesterday and was able to make up two places finishing in 6th place.</description>

      <description>Cross is here‚Ä¶ üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
This weekend was the kickoff of the Stevens Cyclocross Cup here in Northern Germany. It&amp;rsquo;s a double weekend in M√∂lln (races on Saturday and Sunday) which makes for a busy weekend.
Today, Kandie Gang was in full force having four women riding licensed, three in women‚Äôs hobby and two in the men‚Äôs hobby class. Kathi drove her camper out for the weekend and was flying the Kandi Gang banner and providing some baked goodness from the Kandie Shop.</description>

      <title>42. Weihnachtscross</title>

      <description>Yes, the last race of the 2021 was cold1. Very, very cold.
I grew up in Minnesota, so theoretically, I should be okay with this weather. That beind said, I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in Hamburg over 15 years and the weather here is cold but not Minnesota cold. Over the years, my body has acclimated too much to the Northern German winters with their wet and somewhat mild winters.
Needless to say, the 42.</description>

      <title>Butterberg in Elmshorn</title>

      <description>It‚Äôs been two weeks since the last race weekend, and I have to say, it was worth the wait as Gunnar Harms and the RG UNI Hamburg Club created one of the best cyclocross courses of the entire Stevens Cup Series.
The pi√®ce de r√©sistance was the Butterberg; standing at 17 meters tall the Butterberg is more of a hill than a mountain. Nonetheless, Elmshorn‚Äôs tallest point made for some punchy climbs (and a stair section) and fast descents along loamy, hard-packed single track.</description>

      <title>Bumpin&#39; Around Bad Oldesloe</title>

      <description>This weekend was the first cx race weekend in the last three weeks that wasn‚Äôt a double race weekend. And let me tell you, I‚Äôm more than happy about that as Bad Oldesloe was a technical grind with a good amount of climbing and off-camber, muddy descents onto mud slick paved roads.
I ended up 3rd which I‚Äôm quite happy about as I‚Äôve only got my a bike last September of last year.</description>

      <description>The second day of the race weekend I moved up one place on the podium to take a second. As we raced counter clockwise compared to the first day, I felt the course was one where I could find my rhythm and enjoy particular sections such as the mini pump straight and a sandy pinwheel.
During my first lap, I made mistake and overshot the pinwheel going counter clockwise giving the the rider right behind me the perfect opportunity to pass.</description>

      <description>This past weekend was spent in M√∂lln for the fifth and sixth edition of the Stevens Cyclocross Cup. Billed as the ‚ÄúKing of Pirates‚Äù it definitely lived up to its name; with skull and cross bone flags raised on flagpoles to the pirate headwear for podium finishers.
The event took place at the local motorbike track making for a festive, adrenaline-filled venue where spectators could watch the racers on 92% of the course.</description>

      <title>Sun &amp; Rain in Kaltenkirchen</title>

      <description>The fourth round of the Stevens Cyclocross Cup was held in a park in Kaltenkirchen; a good 40 minutes of so from Hamburg. Crusing down the autobahn, we spotted a rainbow off in the horizon in sharp contrast to the darkening sky that was threatening to unleash a deluge of rain upon the course.
And rain it did&amp;hellip;
A few minutes after shedding our warm clothes at the start line, we were sent off with whistle for four laps of a course that consisted of a good amount of climbing, off camber hotdog turns, a 100 meter sand section and a fast descent that lead to a sharp right back halfway up the hill that would loop back to the start line.</description>

      <title>Kolonistenhof of Neu Duvenstedt</title>

      <description>Today was spent in Neu Duvenstedt on the ‚ÄúKolonistenhof‚Äù. The course consisted of grassy farmland with some short but technical single-track. Needless to say, it was a course that demanded one‚Äôs full attention with little time for a breather.
Right off the start, I got caught behind another rider going up the slog of a sandy climb that lead to the farm fields. It wasn‚Äôt long until I was able to pass a few racers and move forward to the second place which I would hold until one rider passed me on the end of the grassy section.</description>

      <title>Tree Runs in Norderstedt</title>

      <description>The second race of the Stevens Cyclocross Cup snake around loamy single-track in the woods of Norderstedt. Tree roots and two soft dirt filled ditches made the course technical. In other words, the kind of riding I used to do racing in the Midwest on 26 inch mountain bikes.
I arrived early to recon the course and was greeted by Kathi and Marla long the way. If there&amp;rsquo;s one lesson I&amp;rsquo;ve learned in my short time racing cyclocross is that you can never know a course well enough.</description>

      <description>Today was the first race of the Stevens Cyclocross Cup 2021/22 in Hannover, Germany. It‚Äôs also been a year of since my first cyclocross race and my third CX race since I bought a bike last September.
This year I actually have some base kilometers from the summer which helped in getting a 10th place finish. Another factor is the gracious nature of the CX community in sharing their experience on and off the bike.</description>
