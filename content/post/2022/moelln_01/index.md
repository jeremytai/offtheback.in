Cross is here‚Ä¶ üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

This weekend was the kickoff of the Stevens Cyclocross Cup here in Northern Germany. It's a double weekend in M√∂lln (races on Saturday and Sunday) which makes for a busy weekend.

Today, Kandie Gang was in full force having four women riding licensed, three in women‚Äôs hobby and two in the men‚Äôs hobby class. Kathi drove her camper out for the weekend and was flying the Kandi Gang banner and providing some baked goodness from the Kandie Shop.

Needless to say, we‚Äôre looking forward to the next eight races with next weekend being in Norderstedt and Hannover. üôå
