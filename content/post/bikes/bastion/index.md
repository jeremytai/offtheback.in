I first remember meeting [Phil](https://www.instagram.com/philipber82/) by the side of the road along the Deich as he was helping [Insea](https://www.instagram.com/pinnihman/) fix a flat.

Later on, we would go on to share a room at the [Orbit360 Bike Festival](/2022/schlaubetal/). It was there that I got to know him and his love for bicycles a bit better.

His latest n+1 is a custom made [Bastion](https://www.bastioncycles.com/); an engineering marvel, with purple-hued carbon tubes and titanium 3D printed lugs adorned with full Shimano Dura Ace components.

One doesn't have to have intimate knowledge about bikes to appreciate the beauty of Phil's Bastion.
