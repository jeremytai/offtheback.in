I woke up at 5:30am to sound of sheets of rain lashing my windows. Although it was still dark outside, I had a feeling today's race in Neu Duvenstedt would be a grind.

The race around the Kolonistenhof has nearly everything that is in a cyclocross race: punchy climbs, off-camber grass sections that lead into [hot dog ðŸŒ­ turns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSbdiJzaj5Q&ab_channel=BehindTheBarriersTV) and a technical back section that includes more of the same but on single-track.  

This year Athledtico BÃ¼delsdorf changed the *parcours* to make it a bit longer; they extended the front section after the hill climb start. This was followed by a series of those grassy off-camber hot dog turns that had everyone check their speed before heading towards the start and off to the back woodsy back section. The only thing that was missing that are predominantly experienced in cyclocross races was was mud.

My race, Masters 3 Men, had the local hitters with the exception of those racing the Budesliga Cross events that took place on Saturday and Sunday. Needless to say, it was still quite a stacked field.

I would end up crossing the line in 12th just ahead of another rim brake rider, Robert from Pirate Bikes. He had been two riders behind me on the last lap, and like a previous race, was using twenty year cyclocross veteran Lars Erdmann as a wheel to move up.

I had let Lars pass me thinking he would proceed to distance me by moving a few bike lengths ahead, but instead, I was able to hold his wheel. This either meant my legs were still strong, he was not as strong as I typically see him or he was riding slower to let his buddy Robert catch up and pass me. Robert did end up passing me on the last grassy knoll before heading into the last technical single-track setion.

Needless to say, I wasn't going to let him go without a fight so I put a move in passing him on the inside of one of the last single-track hot dog turns. He approached me afterward, less than pleased, stating that there wasn't enough room to pass (there was as later verified from a track marshall) and that passing on the inside isn't done in cyclocross. He then said I should watch and learn from races on tv.

Taking this as a learning opportunity I did watch a few races. And yes, people do pass on the inside corner in [cyclocross races ðŸ“º](https://youtu.be/iDSBHGQD-58?feature=shared&t=70).

In other news...as you know by now I enjoy taking photos of the other races when I'm not racing. As I have been approached by a number of people inquiring about the photos and if they can purchase them I have created a shop.

Below are a handful of photos from my team the Kandie Gang but to see the full gallery follow this link **[Neu Duvenstedt Photo Gallery](https://offtheback.zenfoliosite.com/neu-duvenstedt)**
