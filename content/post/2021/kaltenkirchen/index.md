The fourth round of the Stevens Cyclocross Cup was held in a park in Kaltenkirchen; a good 40 minutes of so from Hamburg. Crusing down the autobahn, we spotted a rainbow off in the horizon in sharp contrast to the darkening sky that was threatening to unleash a deluge of rain upon the course.

And rain it did...

A few minutes after shedding our warm clothes at the start line, we were sent off with whistle for four laps of a course that consisted of a good amount of climbing, off camber hotdog turns, a 100 meter sand section and a fast descent that lead to a sharp right back halfway up the hill that would loop back to the start line.

I had a good start, getting the holeshot and riding up the first descent where 5 riders back they ended up walking. My lead would be short lived as I took a digger on the first off camber that lead into the sharp left hotdog turn. I ended up landing on my right side which meant deraillur would suffer and end up leaving me to spin out the rest of the race in two of the lowest gears.

Needless to say, I slipped further back with each lap ending up in the 13th place for the finish. On the bright side, I was able to cleanly clear the sand section üèñÔ∏è 2 out of the 4 laps.
