### Hello, I'm Jeremy.

I believe bikes are a pivotal vehicle to foster new ideas and bolster confidence. In September of 2020 I started riding a lot more and getting into the local bike culture here in Hamburg, Germany.

What brought me back into biking was first the feeling of adventure and then the community; I enjoy the solitary stillness of a solo ride but it's the group rides that make going far fun.

In group rides, you can usually find me [off the back](https://www.instagram.com/_offtheback_/)...
