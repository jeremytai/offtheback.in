      <description>Halloween is a big deal for me as I grew up in the USA where I remember trick or treating from my formative years. So, last October 31st, I did a gravel ride organized by Mattis and decided to dress-up.
This year, I knew I wanted to something where other people could experience the joy of biking in a costume as I did last year. Luckily for me I had a co-conspirator in Christine.</description>
