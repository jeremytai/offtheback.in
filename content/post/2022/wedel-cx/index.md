The week before today, I was out binging on Netflix and copious amount of tea. Yes, my body took a hit after I put in a bit too ambitious run around the Alster. That said, after a week of couch surfing üõãÔ∏è it was time to test the lungs and line-up for the 8th race in the Stevens Cyclocross Series.

Being that it was RG Wedel's first cross race, and I hadn't had the chance to preride before today, I was looking forward to experiencing a completely new cyclocross course. I was also looking to ride with the other 78(!) people that were registered in my age group.

During my pre-ride of the new course, I remembered riding some of the same trails during the [RG Wedel e.V. CTF](https://offtheback.in/2022/wedel/) that I rode in January of this year. In the end, the course was fast and friendly with only three obstacles where I had to dismount from my bike and jump over.

Bravo Martin üëè

## H2 Onto the Race
Of the 78 men that registered only 30 showed up ü§∑. After getting a good start I was able to hold onto third place before being swallowed up by three others, and ultimately, finishing in seventh.

Thankful, and grateful, for all the support along the way ü•≥!
