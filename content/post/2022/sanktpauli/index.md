Today was the one year anniversary of [Kandie Gang](https://kandiegang.com/) Social Rides, and let me tell you, it was a quite a ride. We grew from [11 riders](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQKCe4PHyJX/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY%3D) to over 50 today. Although we have grown, the Kandie Gang ethos and purpose remain the same:

It’s about Streetlife.

It’s about Urbanity.

It’s about Gettin Together.

It’s about Having Fun.

It’s about Riding.

It’s about Adventure.

It’s about Gettin Out.

It’s about Freedom.

It’s about Nature.

**It’s a Lovestory.**

no gender. no race. no ignorance. no hate.
just love. just tolerance. just peace.

[Join us](https://www.strava.com/clubs/kandiegang) on our next ride.
