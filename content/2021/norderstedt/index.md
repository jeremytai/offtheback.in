The second race of the Stevens Cyclocross Cup snake around loamy single-track in the woods of Norderstedt. Tree roots and two soft dirt filled ditches made the course technical. In other words, the kind of riding I used to do racing in the Midwest on 26 inch mountain bikes.

I arrived early to recon the course and was greeted by Kathi and Marla long the way. If there's one lesson I've learned in my short time racing cyclocross is that you can never know a course well enough.

I had a great start (top three) but the third corner I came in too hot and dropped my bike which put me back in to fifth place. I'd make my way back into third and would hold that until the end.
