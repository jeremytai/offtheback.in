The second day of the race weekend I moved up one place on the podium to take a second. As we raced counter clockwise compared to the first day, I felt the course was one where I could find my rhythm and enjoy particular sections such as the mini pump straight and a sandy pinwheel.

During my first lap, I made mistake and overshot the pinwheel going counter clockwise giving the the rider right behind me the perfect opportunity to pass. Fortunately for me, I was able to pass him and keep my place in second until the finish.
