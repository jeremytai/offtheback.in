Here in Germany, May 8th was a holiday which meant there was also the [32nd Grand Prize of Buchholz](https://radsport-buchholz.de/grosser-preis/); a road criterium with a 2.8km loop including an 8% incline. [Lea Lützen](https://www.instagram.com/leas_tri_journey/) was racing as well a handful of other people that I knew, so I decided to check it out and and take a few photos.

I also met Lea Luise who was there with her son supporting his St. Pauli teammates racing in the under 15 age group so I stayed to watch that and then rode back to Hamburg.
