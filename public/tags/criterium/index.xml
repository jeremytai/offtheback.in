      <description>Today was the 3rd race in the Specialized-Cup Series and my first criterium in Germany. I signed-up thinking I&amp;rsquo;d like to see how my fitness is leading into the summer months and also to see what crit racing was like in Hamburg.
Bad Oldesloe was the same location where there was one of the more demanding cyclocross races from last year. With punchy climbs and some extremely fast downhills leading into fast turns, the criterium didn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint.</description>

      <description>After hearing about a local crit in Hamburg, I took the train to meet up with Paul and some other to support Lea LÃ¼tzen, one of our Kandie Gang/ St. Pauli teammates. When we arrived, I met Lea who wasn&amp;rsquo;t on the start line. She said the organizers didn&amp;rsquo;t get her registration although the money went through and she was announced as racing over the loudspeaker ðŸ¤·.
We ended up watching the race together, but I could tell she would have rather been mixing it up with the others then watching from the sidelines.</description>
