This past Sunday Wedel was host to the first epically muddy cyclocross race of the season. Being that Iâ€™m more technically capable and less like a diesel motor, the conditions were my kind of fun.

After a second row start, I would ride into top third position in the first lap. I was able to hold that until the final lap in which I was passed by two other riders in the last quarter of the race.

In the end, things are moving forwardâ€¦with a tenth place finish among twenty-seven starters.

See you next weekend in MÃ¶lln ðŸŽ‰
