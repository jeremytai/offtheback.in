Hello, I'm Jeremy. I've been riding bikes for as long as I can remember but it's only in September of 2020 that I started riding a lot more and getting into the local bike culture here in Hamburg.

What brought me back to biking (I used to race mountain bikes in the 90's) was first the feeling of freedom and then the community. I enjoy the solitary stillness of a solo ride but it's the group rides that make going far fun.

In group rides, you can usually find me [off the back](https://www.instagram.com/_offtheback_/)...
