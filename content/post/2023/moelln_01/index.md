Growing up in the USA, rainy Saturday mornings were quite often reserved for cartoons ðŸ“º

But that was many, many years ago. This past weekend Saturday morning was spent an hour outside of Hamburg on a motorcycle track racing cyclocross bikes.

A race that started dirty and muddy and ended dirtier and muddier. That said, I wouldnâ€™t have changed it for any Popeye the Sailor Man episodes or other cartoons from my formative years.

Thank you for the support as I pushed the pedals to a thirteenth place among the twenty-two other men that had the privilege to suffer along with one another.
