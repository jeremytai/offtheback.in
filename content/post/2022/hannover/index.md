Hannover is just under two hours away from Hamburg when it's 7:00 am in morning on a national holiday. That said, I was up early to pack the car and pick-up [Katrin](https://www.instagram.com/clara_bow/) for the fourth series in the [Stevens Cyclocross Cup](https://my.raceresult.com/groups/5068/). Last year this was the [first race](https://offtheback.in/2021/hannover/) of the series making for a slow transition into what would be my first full season of racing.

As my race started first, the ground was still sticky with pasty mud and wet grass. Hannover being the furthest race in the series meant that our Kandie Gang supporters consisted mostly of those that were racing. This meant that I didn't have anyone to take my jacket at the start and ended up hanging it up near the finish making me late to the call-ups. Needless to say, I elected to start from the second row as the location I could have taken in the first row was less than ideal.

Yesterday's race and the early drive took its toll and I missed bridging to the rider in front of me with the consequence being another fifth place like Sunday's race.
