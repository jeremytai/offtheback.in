From 08.08 - 09.09 is the Faustformel for the Heideblüten. It’s with this in mind that we took advantage of yesterday’s epic weather and rolled out from the Kandie Shop through the Harburger trails to the Fischbeker Heide.

And as it’s already September 2nd, that means we are in the last days of summer…and cross is coming (gravel too)!
