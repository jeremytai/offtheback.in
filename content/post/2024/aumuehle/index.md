Sunday was the 2nd Kandie Gang Edition of Orbit360‚Äôs [Ride for a Reason](https://www.orbit360.cc/ridefar). The Hamburg edition was initiated by Kathi which entailed one epic 100km route to ride:

Seven weeks ago Kathi had a group of us test [ride](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4FpbWMsMW5/) it so, I knew how much fun it'd be for more people.

With the sun shining and single digit temperatures, I set off promptly at 8:15. This gave me enough time to grab a matcha latte and a sweet baked good at Copenhagen Coffee Lab before meeting the rest of the Kandie Gang at 9:00.

When we reached the last stop of the train and our destination, we met another fourteen or so other gravelleurs and set off for our Sunday rideFAR adventure.

Thank you Kathi for initiating and planning 100km of all-road goodness.

Here‚Äôs to my next #rideFAR üíï
