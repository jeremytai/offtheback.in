Today was spent in Neu Duvenstedt on the ‚ÄúKolonistenhof‚Äù. The course consisted of grassy farmland with some short but technical single-track. Needless to say, it was a course that demanded one‚Äôs full attention with little time for a breather.

Right off the start, I got caught behind another rider going up the slog of a sandy climb that lead to the farm fields. It wasn‚Äôt long until I was able to pass a few racers and move forward to the second place which I would hold until one rider passed me on the end of the grassy section. I was able to take home 3rd place while building a comfortable lead over the rider behind me that was on a mountain bike.

This race season is quite a contrast to last; with having ridden a good amount of base miles from the summer and being part of the @kandie_gang family (motivated, fun-loving folks that support one another throughout the journey) has made all the difference.
