      <description>I first remember meeting Phil by the side of the road along the Deich as he was helping Insea fix a flat.
Later on, we would go on to share a room at the Orbit360 Bike Festival. It was there that I got to know him and his love for bicycles a bit better.
His latest n+1 is a custom made Bastion; an engineering marvel, with purple-hued carbon tubes and titanium 3D printed lugs adorned with full Shimano Dura Ace components.</description>
