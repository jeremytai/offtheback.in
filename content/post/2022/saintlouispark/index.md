Cyclocross is finally[^1] here.

Here being Minnesota where I've been for the past six weeks or so for the summer. With cyclocross season just around the corner in Germany, I was stoked to be able give my legs a warm start into the coming race season by entering the first of six [Tuesday Night CX](https://endurancepromotions.com/uploads/flyers/2022_TNCX_Flyerp4.pdf) races held around the suburbs of Minneapolis.

An 18:00 start with temperatures at 26Â°C (80Â°F) and humidity of 46% ðŸ¥µ was in complete contrast to what I'm used to [cyclocross racing](http://offtheback.in/tags/cyclocross/) in Europe. Thank goodness the course was extremely forgiving as it snaked along 1.8km (1.11miles) of the grass-covered rolling hill of Aquila Park. There were no necessary dismounts (sand or barriers) which made for a fast and furious, blood-pumping forty-five minute race in the Intermediate/Masters/Women category I entered.

It's not the result I was hoping for...but the inviting, community vibe more than made up for placing 18th. This being my third race in Minnesota this summer (the first being a criterium and the second being the [bandit cross](https://www.instagram.com/p/ChXKi55uxt2/)) it's enlightening to experience the different layers of the Minnesota cycling culture.

Needless to say, Minnesota cycling is alive and well.
