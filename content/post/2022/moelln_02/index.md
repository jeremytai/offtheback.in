Cross is here...day 02 üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

Like last year, the second half of the race weekend in M√∂lln is run on the same course as the [first day](/2022/moelln_01/) but in the opposite direction; in this case counter clockwise. I definitely felt the course had more flow to it as we didn't have the longish climb on the backside making for quicker course times.

I felt better than yesterday and was able to make up two places finishing in 6th place. The earlier race times (my age group is the first race of the day) suits me well as I wake up by 6:00am everyday anyway.

| 6th of 24 | [Full Results PDF](20220925_02_moelln_te.pdf) |
| Distance **10.20km** | Moving Time **32.22** |

Sidenote: I started my Wahoo one lap into the race...and not sure I really need it during racing. Therefore, I'm going back to using my Garmin watch on race days.
