      <description>Halloween is a big deal for me as I grew up in the USA where I remember trick or treating from my formative years. So, last October 31st, I did a gravel ride organized by Mattis and decided to dress-up.
This year, I knew I wanted to something where other people could experience the joy of biking in a costume as I did last year. Luckily for me I had a co-conspirator in Christine.</description>

      <description>Today was the one year anniversary of Kandie Gang Social Rides, and let me tell you, it was a quite a ride. We grew from 11 riders to over 50 today. Although we have grown, the Kandie Gang ethos and purpose remain the same:
It’s about Streetlife.
It’s about Urbanity.
It’s about Gettin Together.
It’s about Having Fun.
It’s about Riding.
It’s about Adventure.
It’s about Gettin Out.
It’s about Freedom.</description>
