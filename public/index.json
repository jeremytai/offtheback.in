Although it was still dark outside, I had a feeling today\u0026rsquo;s race in Neu Duvenstedt would be a grind.\nThe race around the Kolonistenhof has nearly everything that is in a cyclocross race: punchy climbs, off-camber grass sections that lead into hot dog üå≠ turns and a technical back section that includes more of the same but on single-track.\nThis year Athledtico B√ºdelsdorf changed the parcours to make it a bit longer; they extended the front section after the hill climb start. This was followed by a series of those grassy off-camber hot dog turns that had everyone check their speed before heading towards the start and off to the back woodsy back section. The only thing that was missing that are predominantly experienced in cyclocross races was was mud.\nüîó View the full Neu Duvenstedt Photo Gallery photo gallery\nMy race, Masters 3 Men, had the local hitters with the exception of those racing the Bundesliga Cross events that took place on Saturday and Sunday. Needless to say, it was still quite a stacked field.\nI would end up crossing the line in 12th just ahead of another rim brake rider, Robert from Pirate Bikes. He had been two riders behind me on the last lap, and like a previous race, was using twenty year cyclocross veteran Lars Erdmann as a wheel to move up.\nKathi on the last hot dog turn before the finish.\nI had let Lars pass me thinking he would proceed to distance me by moving a few bike lengths ahead, but instead, I was able to hold his wheel. This either meant my legs were still strong, he was not as strong as I typically see him or he was riding slower to let his buddy Robert catch up and pass me. Robert did end up passing me on the last grassy knoll before heading into the last technical single-track setion.\nNeedless to say, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to let him go without a fight so I put a move in passing him on the inside of one of the last single-track hot dog turns. He approached me afterward, less than pleased, stating that there wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough room to pass (there was as later verified from a track marshall) and that passing on the inside isn\u0026rsquo;t done in cyclocross. He then said I should watch and learn from races on tv.\nTaking this as a learning opportunity I did watch a few races. And yes, people do pass on the inside corner in cyclocross races üì∫.\nüîó Neu Duvenstedt Photo Gallery In other news\u0026hellip;as you know by now I enjoy taking photos of the other races when I\u0026rsquo;m not racing.

After the start, and on the first climb, I felt the Masters World Champion brush by my outside right thigh and pass me. It was only a matter of short time as he was on the start grid right behind me.\nA lap and a half later I settled into a small group of some familiar faces from previous races. But this wasn\u0026rsquo;t to be the full story as the punchy climbs, and somewhat technical single-track, had me move ahead of people that are typcally in front of me.\nWhile a fourteeth place finish might seem like I\u0026rsquo;ve dropped back a place or two, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t tell the whole story; we\u0026rsquo;ve never had a field this deep that included all the hitters.

That said, I was able to ride all of the technical sections, except for one heavily rutted muddy incline that had me on my side three times before I could ride it.

After falling back a few places and settling in on the first lap I was able to get back into a pace that had me take home an 8th place.\nOn the last lap, with a long gap in front of me and another behind me, I took it easy and rolled a little bit with Janine and finished up with Katrin.\nAfterwards, we stayed and watched a few more races and celebrated Lea Luise\u0026rsquo;s birthday ü•≥ with cake from her mom and an apple one from Janine.\nNeu Duvenstedt - Stevens Cyclocross Cup #6 All photographs appearing in the website are the exclusive property of Jeremy Tai Abbett (unless stated otherwise) and are protected under international copyright laws.

Last year this was the first race of the series making for a slow transition into what would be my first full season of racing.\nAs my race started first, the ground was still sticky with pasty mud and wet grass. Hannover being the furthest race in the series meant that our Kandie Gang supporters consisted mostly of those that were racing. This meant that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have anyone to take my jacket at the start and ended up hanging it up near the finish making me late to the call-ups. Needless to say, I elected to start from the second row as the location I could have taken in the first row was less than ideal.\nYesterday\u0026rsquo;s race and the early drive took its toll and I missed bridging to the rider in front of me with the consequence being another fifth place like Sunday\u0026rsquo;s race.\nHannover - Stevens Cyclocross Cup #4 All photographs appearing in the website are the exclusive property of Jeremy Tai Abbett (unless stated otherwise) and are protected under international copyright laws.

That said, it sure was fun to get the heart pumping with seventy-eight other riders as we made our way up the frontside of the hill and descended down the backside of the tight and sandy single track.\nAs I don\u0026rsquo;t have a mountain bike in Minnesota, I had the good fortune of borrowing a bike that I rode for the first time earlier in the day mounted with my Favero Assimoma pedals and my full carbon soled Bont Vapor S road shoes. My choice in pedals and shoes would ultimately cost me a good start (I got taken down and went over the bars trying to clip in ü§™) and later, drop me down four places as I lost my front wheel in a sandy corner and laid the bike down (clipping out took too long as well as clipping back in).

Needless to say, I was caught by her contagious enthusiasm and was all in when the registration for this year\u0026rsquo;s edition opened up.\nWhich brings us to Friday and sitting in the back of Cindy\u0026rsquo;s cherry red VW Bulle, with Christina riding shotgun, on the way east past Berlin to a small village in Brandenburg, Germany. In my hasty preparations (I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to bring a sleeping bag) I forgot my on-bike nutrition for Saturday\u0026rsquo;s race and all that other food that one needs for a long weekend.\nThankfully, Christina hooked me up with the bike nutrition and the Gravity Bike Festival had enough food for the whole weekend. Upon arrival, we registered and I went to check out the bungalow I was sharing with Philip while Cindy and Christina went to the campsite to set-up their lodging.\nRace Day Plenty of free seats if you have breakfast before 8am.\nI typically wake-up around 5:30 - 6:00am and Saturday was no different. That said, with a 9:00am start for the 173km gravel race on the horizon I made sure to eat a solid breakfast, get my bike in order as well as my mind and body (luck favors the prepared).\nSaturday\u0026rsquo;s race was the only one in the Orbit360 Series that would have a mass start making for a few collective nerves as well as a strong shared experience aspect to it all. And like most gravel races, the peloton would thin out into a ragged line of riders, each finding their own group to ride with to the end.\nThere was a good amount of sand (I was used to it from cyclocross) and a long 8km section of loose gravel (it had me thinking twice about a future participation in Unbound Gravel). Everything else (cobblestones, single-track and a smooth pavement section or two) was nestled into the wilderness that East Germany offers.\nThe course was challenging but not enough to drain me of a solo 200m sprint to the line. In lieu of a crowd of 100s of people bearing witness to my last effort, there were two other finishers offering words of encouragement that came in just before me.\n(Results to follow when released by Orbit360)\nüìí Orbit360 - Gravity Circuit üóìÔ∏è June 4th, 2022 üö≤ 123.24km with 779m elevation üåû Light rain, 17¬∞C, Feels like 16¬∞C, Humidity 68%, Wind 10km/h from N üìç Komoot link: Gravity Circuit 2022 Rest Day Early on into the game of footdown.\nSunday was reserved for the Scavenger Hunt in the morning and a game of Footdown in the evening.

We ended up staying at a restaurant ordering caf√® con leche to warm the body followed by grilled sandwiches and locally baked chocolate and almond cake.\nIt was still raining out so we stayed a bit longer to watch MvdP move to the front of the pack in the Tour of Flanders with nearly 50km to go.

I can\u0026rsquo;t remember when I last did a nearly hour of just climbing\u0026hellip;perhaps when I live in Vail, Colorado and we used to climb the mountain after work.\nLunch was taken in a village restaurant along the top of the climb, 74km into the ride, in the village of Deia.
