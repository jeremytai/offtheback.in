The second race in the Stevens Cyclocross Cup took place in Hannover along the banks of the Ihme River.

With the first race being my favorite in the series, Ihme is one of my least favorite b/c it’s a course with very little technical sections which doesn’t suit my style of riding.

That being said, the organizers make the best they can with the space they have making it a privilege to race here…and take home another 13th place in a field of 32 starters.

The next race is in Wedel on Sunday the 15th.
