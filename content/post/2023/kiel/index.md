The last race of the season was also my first race as a UCI licensed Masters 3 in cyclocross. It was also my first time racing cyclocross in Kiel. Needless to say, I was looking forward to rolling up on the line with a group of riders that have been in the game for a while.

During my warm-up I noticed my rear tire was lower than I had just pumped it up to...ðŸ¤”

In spite of lining up in the second row, I was in fourth place going into the backside of the course; a course that was all about pumping out the power with very few technical sections. In other words, not really my kind of course.

It was during the second lap that I noticed my rear tire losing air, and ultimately, going completely flat in the second lap. Unfortunately, I didn't bring a spare bike or extra wheels so my option were:

1. Quit
2. Finish with a rear flat ðŸ« 

As I already was in Kiel, and the course was quite forgiving for riding on a flat, I made the decision to finish all five laps...as I saw more and more people pass me. I ended up finishing 9th of the ten people that lined up.

Afterwards, I stayed and watched the women's race and the beginning of the Elite Men's race taking photos and cheering on the team and all those that I've gotten to known in my last two years of racing cyclocross.
